# 🖥️ Automated Asset Inventory & Classification (Ansible | NIST CSF ID.AM)
An Ansible-based automation project designed to discover, classify, and document enterprise assets in alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) — specifically the IDENTIFY (ID) function and Asset Management (ID.AM-1 through ID.AM-5) controls.

This project focuses on building repeatable, production-safe automation that improves asset visibility, strengthens governance, and lays the groundwork for risk management and incident readiness.
