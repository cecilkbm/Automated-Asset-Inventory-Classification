Project Name:NIST Security Automation
Goal: Harden managed host security via Ansbile Play-books

1. IDENTIFY Function
Objective: Develop organizational understanding of cybersecurity risks

Play 1: Asset Inventory and Classification
NIST CSF: ID.AM (Asset Management)
- Gather system information (OS, version, hardware)
- Enumerate installed software packages
- Identify running services and open ports
- Document network interfaces and IP configurations
- Tag assets by criticality (high/medium/low)
- Store inventory in central fact cache or CMDB

Play 2: Vulnerability Assessment
NIST CSF: ID.RA (Risk Assessment)
- Check for outdated packages/software versions
- Scan for known CVEs using vulnerability databases
- Verify SSL/TLS certificate expiration dates
- Check for default credentials on common services
- Generate risk score per host
- Create vulnerability report

2. PROTECT Function
Objective: Implement safeguards to ensure delivery of services

Play 3: Access Control Hardening
NIST CSF: PR.AC (Access Control)
- Enforce password complexity policies
- Configure account lockout thresholds
- Disable unnecessary user accounts
- Implement SSH key-based authentication
- Disable root login via SSH
- Configure sudo access with least privilege
- Set up MFA where applicable

Play 4: System Hardening
NIST CSF: PR.IP (Information Protection Processes)
- Apply CIS benchmarks or STIG guidelines
- Disable unnecessary services
- Configure host-based firewall (iptables/firewalld)
- Set proper file permissions on sensitive files
- Enable SELinux/AppArmor
- Configure secure logging
- Disable USB storage if not needed

Play 5: Data Protection
NIST CSF: PR.DS (Data Security)
- Encrypt data at rest (LUKS/dm-crypt)
- Configure encrypted backup destinations
- Set up file integrity monitoring (AIDE/Tripwire)
- Implement data retention policies
- Configure secure NFS/SMB shares with proper permissions

Play 6: Patch Management
NIST CSF: PR.IP-12 (Vulnerability Management)
- Check available security updates
- Create system snapshots/backups before patching
- Apply critical security patches
- Update system firmware (where applicable)
- Reboot systems if required
- Verify patch application

3. DETECT Function
Objective: Identify occurrence of cybersecurity events

Play 7: Logging and Monitoring Setup
NIST CSF: DE.CM (Continuous Monitoring)
- Configure centralized logging (rsyslog/syslog-ng)
- Set up log rotation policies
- Enable auditd for system call auditing
- Configure failed authentication logging
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- Deploy OSSEC/Wazuh agents

Play 8: Security Event Detection
NIST CSF: DE.AE (Anomalies and Events)
- Monitor for failed login attempts
- Detect privilege escalation attempts
- Check for unauthorized file modifications
- Scan for rootkits (rkhunter/chkrootkit)
- Monitor network connections for anomalies
- Check for indicators of compromise (IoCs)

4. RESPOND Function
Objective: Take action regarding detected cybersecurity incidents

Play 9: Incident Response Preparation
NIST CSF: RS.RP (Response Planning)
- Create incident response playbook structure
- Document chain of custody procedures
- Set up isolated forensic environment
- Configure automated backup triggers
- Establish communication channels (Slack/email notifications)

Play 10: Automated Response Actions
NIST CSF: RS.MI (Mitigation)
- Block malicious IPs via firewall
- Isolate compromised systems (network segmentation)
- Disable compromised user accounts
- Kill suspicious processes
- Snapshot system state for forensics
- Trigger alerts to security team

5. RECOVER Function
Objective: Restore capabilities or services impaired due to incident

Play 11: System Recovery
NIST CSF: RC.RP (Recovery Planning)
- Restore from known-good backups
- Rebuild compromised systems from baseline
- Verify system integrity post-recovery
- Re-apply security configurations
- Validate service functionality
- Document lessons learned

Play 12: Post-Incident Validation
NIST CSF: RC.IM (Improvements)
- Run compliance checks against baseline
- Verify all security controls are operational
- Re-scan for vulnerabilities
- Update security policies based on incident
- Generate post-incident report

Project Enhancement Ideas
Master Playbook Structure:
- Include variables for environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Use Ansible Vault for sensitive data
- Implement tags for selective execution
- Create roles for reusability
- Use handlers for service restarts
- Implement idempotency checks
- Add dry-run/check mode support

Reporting & Documentation:
- Generate HTML compliance reports
- Create dashboards with metrics
- Map each play to specific NIST CSF controls
- Include references to control IDs in play comments
- Track compliance percentage
